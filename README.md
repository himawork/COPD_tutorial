# COPD_tutorial

## Introduction
Welcome to the COPD Tutorial repository! This project provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the effects of high-sugar intake and deprssion disorders on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD encompasses conditions like emphysema and chronic bronchitis, often caused by long-term exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke.

This tutorial is designed for healthcare professionals, students, and anyone interested in learning about COPD. It covers (I) The epidemiological trends of YLDs for COPD, high-sugar intake, and depression; (II) The gender differences in  Lee-Carter model and the Bayesian APC model of COPD populations; (III) The gender differences in the interaction between sugar intake and depression on COPD; (IV) The causal association between sugar intake/depression and COPD.

## Getting Started
### What You'll Learn
- The current global COPD population burden and the predicted trends for the next 20 years;
- The associations of YLDs between high-sugar intake or depression disorders and COPD;
- The synergistic interaction exists between sugar intake and depression;
- Sugar intake and depression increase the risk of COPD based on genetic evidence;
- The critical role of psychological status and dietary sugar intake in COPD management.
